# Changing Mochiboard

Mochiboard is two layers that talk through one small channel. Most changes only touch one of them.

```
web/            the canvas: everything you see and do (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step)
  index.html      the page: panels, settings, dialogs
  app.js          the canvas itself: cards, tools, Mochi's chat, settings, updates bar, tour
  style.css       all the styling (light and dark)
  bridge.js       window.MB: the canvas's only way to reach the host (or a pretend host in a browser)
  vendor/         prebuilt TipTap editor and .docx writer (source in tools/editor/)
linux/          the host: an Electron main process
  main.js         window, keys, permissions, mbmedia://, and the table of bridge operations (OPS)
  preload.js      provides window.webkit.messageHandlers.mb to the page
  storage.js      boards, folders and videos on disk
  claude.js       finding and running Claude Code, usage tally, connections
  prompts.js      everything Mochi is told (edit her personality and abilities here)
  output.js       PNG / PDF export, .docx save, paged doc PDFs
  speech.js       voice memo transcription (whisper.cpp)
  update.js       updates for git installs and the AppImage
  paths.js        where things are kept (XDG folders)
tests/smoke.js  opens the real app and checks every bridge operation
install.sh  uninstall.sh  make-release.sh  packaging/
```

## How the canvas talks to the host

`web/bridge.js` sends `{id, op, args}` through `window.webkit.messageHandlers.mb.postMessage`. In the app, `linux/preload.js` passes it to `linux/main.js`, which looks the op up in `OPS`. The answer goes back over IPC (`mb-reply`), and preload.js hands it to the page's `__mbReply(id, ok, value)`. Nothing is turned into script, so big boards and pictures pass through quickly. In a plain browser, bridge.js uses localStorage and a pretend Mochi instead.

**To add a new ability that needs the computer** (a file, a program, the network):
1. Add the op to `OPS` in `linux/main.js` (put real work in a module next to it).
2. Add a matching method to the `native` side of `window.MB` in `web/bridge.js`, and a browser fallback.
3. Call `MB.yourThing()` from `web/app.js`.
4. Add a check for it in `tests/smoke.js`.

**To change only the canvas** (a card type, a tool, a setting, the look): edit `web/`, then reload the window (F12 → Ctrl+R in DevTools), or work on it in a browser with `python3 -m http.server` in `web/`.

**To change what Mochi does:** her instructions are in `linux/prompts.js`. The JSON she answers with is applied by `applyMochi()` in `web/app.js`.

## Running and testing

```bash
npm install            # Electron, electron-builder, Playwright (for tests)
npm start              # run from the code
xvfb-run -a node tests/smoke.js     # or just `node tests/smoke.js` in a desktop session
./install.sh           # install your changed copy (Settings → Update now pulls from the git remote)
./make-release.sh --dry             # build the AppImage into build/release/
```

The smoke test uses a throwaway data folder and stand-in `claude` and `whisper-cli` programs, so it never touches your boards or spends Claude usage.

## Releasing

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` and add a section at the top of `WHATSNEW.md` (lines starting with `- ` become the notes people see in the app).
2. Commit and push.
3. `./make-release.sh` builds the AppImage and publishes a GitHub Release (needs `gh auth login`). AppImage users get it through their update bar; git installs see the new commits.

## Where it came from

The canvas and Mochi are by [Jessa Wolfe](https://jessa.art), from [jessawolfe-ux/mochiboard](https://github.com/jessawolfe-ux/mochiboard) 1.4.1 (MIT). The Mac app's Swift host was replaced by `linux/`; this repo is now its own project and doesn't track the Mac repo.
